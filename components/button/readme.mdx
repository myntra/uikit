### Writing Labels

Buttons are clickable items used to perform an action. Use buttons to trigger actions and links. Buttons can contain a combination of a clear label and an icon while links are always text.

### What to do

* Prioritize the most important actions, based on the hierarchy. Too many calls to action can cause confusion and make users unsure of what to do next.
* Be positioned in consistent locations in the interface. for example, most Primary call to action are placed on the extreme right side of the screen on babylon.

## Types of Buttons

### Primary Button

To call attention to an action on a form, or highlight the strongest call to action on a page. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen
(application header or modal dialog aren’t included).

```jsx preview
<Button type="primary">Primary Button</Button>
```

### Secondary Button

Use against shaded or colorful backgrounds. An Secondary button will maintain the appropriate visual weight and won’t clash with the
background color and maintain the visual hierarchy.

```jsx preview
<Button type="secondary">Secondary Button</Button>
```

### Text Button

Use for less important or less commonly used actions since they’re less prominent. The drop menu shows a list of related actions.

```jsx preview
<Button type="text">Text Button</Button>
```


## Icon Button

```jsx preview
<Button icon="ellipsis-v" />
```

## Composition

A button can have an icon.

```jsx preview
<>
  <Button type="primary" icon="chevron-left">prev</Button>
  <Button type="primary" disabled>current</Button>
  <Button type="primary" secondaryIcon="chevron-right">next</Button>
</>
```

## Events

The `onClick` prop can be used to provide.

```jsx preview
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

<Button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
  {count ? `Clicked ${count} time(s)` : 'Click Me!'}
</Button>
```
