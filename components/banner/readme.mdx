# Banner

<Documenter component={Banner}>

```jsx preview
<Banner>
  {'An alert message.'}
</Banner>
```

</Documenter>

* Put banners close in context to the problem they’re referring to.
* Give banners with a lot of information a clear title(if needed) that summarizes their content.
* Be concise and scannable—users shouldn’t need to spend a lot of time figuring out what they need to know and do.
* Use the default icon for success, info, warning and critical statuses.

## Types

```jsx preview
<>
  <Banner type="error">An example of error alert.</Banner>
  <Banner type="warning">An example of warning alert.</Banner>
  <Banner type="success">An example of success alert.</Banner>
</>
```

## Banner with Title

```jsx preview
<Banner title="SUCCESS!">The file has been uploaded.</Banner>
```

## Customising Icon

```jsx preview
<Banner title="CRITICAL ERROR" icon="bomb">We cannot reach to the backend service, your changes could not be persisted.</Banner>
```

```jsx preview
<Banner icon={null}>Your email address is required to send the report.</Banner>
```

## Dismissable Banner

```jsx preview
function Example() {
  const [isVisible, setVisible] = useState(true);

  return isVisible &&
    <Banner type="warning" title={'CAUTION!'} onClose={() => setVisible(false)}>
      The image you are trying to upload has invalid format. It might not render well.
    </Banner>
}
```
