# Banner

<Documenter component={Banner}>

```jsx preview
<Banner>
  {'An alert message.'}
</Banner>
```

</Documenter>

* Put banners close in context to the problem they’re referring to.
* Give banners with a lot of information a clear title(if needed) that summarizes their content.
* Be concise and scannable—users shouldn’t need to spend a lot of time figuring out what they need to know and do.
* Use the default icon for success, info, warning and critical statuses.

## Default Banner

Banners relevant to an entire page should be placed at the top of that page, below the page header. They should occupy the full width of the content area.

Banners related to a section of a page should be placed inside that section, below any section heading. These banners have less spacing and a pared-back design to fit within a content context.

```jsx preview
<>
  <Banner type="error">An example of error alert.</Banner>
  <Banner type="warning">An example of warning alert.</Banner>
  <Banner type="success">An example of success alert.</Banner>
  <Banner type="primary">An example of primary alert.</Banner>
  <Banner title="ERRR!">An example of primary alert.</Banner>
</>
```

## Dismissable Banner

```jsx preview
function Example() {
  const [isVisible, setVisible] = useState(true);

  return isVisible &&
    <Banner type="warning" title={'CAUTION!'} onClose={() => setVisible(false)}>
      The image you are trying to upload has invalid format. It might not render well.
    </Banner>
}
```
