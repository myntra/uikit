# UIKit

The UIKit is a design system which aims to establish a common vocabulary between everyone in an organization.
It captures repeating design structures, conventions, and, decisions across dozens of applications and builds as re-usable pattern library.

UIKit is continuous effort of finding new pattens and decomissioning older irrelavent pattens, so we adopt a component status convention.

| Icon | Status       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|  💔  | DEPRECATED   | **DO NOT USE.** If you're using DEPRECATED component, it's time to migrate as it would removed in next major release.                                                                                                |
|  ❤️  | EXPERIMENTAL | **USE WITH CAUTION.** These components are most likely to graduate to **REVIEWING** state but they can be ocassionally **DEPRECATED** too. If you're using EXPERIMENTAL component, keep your application up to date. |
|  💛  | REVIEWING    | These components are as good as READY component. They would graduate to **READY** after a fixed time (approx. 3 months or 3 minor releases or next major release).                                                   |
|  💚  | READY        | These components are well tested, stable and proven.                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Getting Started

Install UIKit in your project:

```bash
npm add @myntra/uikit
```

Install UIKit with unity theme:

```bash
npm add @myntra/uikit-theme-unity
```

Include CSS reset for global styles:

```jsx
// In the entry file of your application.
import '@myntra/uikit/design.css';
```

Now you can use components from UIKit, a good starting point would be [Page](/components/page) component.

## UIKit migration

UIKit migration can be done by installing the theme packages for migrateing the components gradually in stages.

Steps to migrate:

```bash
npm add @myntra/uikit-theme-unity

or

npm add @myntra/uikit-theme-nuclei
```

```jsx
import { Button } from '@myntra/uikit-theme-unity'
```
