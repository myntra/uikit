# UIKit

The UIKit is a design system which aims to establish a common vocabulary between everyone in an organization.
It captures repeating design structures, conventions, and, decisions across dozens of applications and builds as re-usable pattern library.

UIKit is continuous effort of finding new pattens and decomissioning older irrelavent pattens, so we adopt a component status convention.

| Icon | Status       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|  üíî  | DEPRECATED   | **DO NOT USE.** If you're using DEPRECATED component, it's time to migrate as it would removed in next major release.                                                                                                |
|  ‚ù§Ô∏è  | EXPERIMENTAL | **USE WITH CAUTION.** These components are most likely to graduate to **REVIEWING** state but they can be ocassionally **DEPRECATED** too. If you're using EXPERIMENTAL component, keep your application up to date. |
|  üíõ  | REVIEWING    | These components are as good as READY component. They would graduate to **READY** after a fixed time (approx. 3 months or 3 minor releases or next major release).                                                   |
|  üíö  | READY        | These components are well tested, stable and proven.                                                                                                                                                                 |
