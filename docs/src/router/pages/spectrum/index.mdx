# Spectrum CLI

A webpack based development environment with zero-config build system heavily inspired from [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/). It uses plugins to enhance build-time and runtime experience.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --global @myntra/spectrum-cli@alpha
```

You might need to setup Myntra private npm registry. Skip this if above command finished without any error.

```bash
npm config --global set @myntra:registry http://registry.myntra.com:8000/
```

To test the spectrum setup, run following command.

```bash
spectrum --version

# Output
# 2.0.0-alpha.62
```

## Guide

### Create a new project

To create a new project, run:

```bash
spectrum create hello-world
```

You will be prompted to pick a preset. You can either choose the default preset which comes with a basic Babel + ESLint setup, or select "Manually select features" to pick the features you need.

The default setup is great for quickly prototyping a new project.

Start development server:

```bash
yarn serve
```

### Application architecture

A freshly created spectrum project would have following files and folders:

```
- @types/
- README.md
- babel.config.js
- jsconfig.json
- node_modules/
- package.json
- public/
- spectrum.config.js
- src/
- yarn.lock
```

`package.json`, `yarn.lock` and `node_modules/` are used by NPM (the node package manager).

`jsconfig.json` and `@types` are create when you run spectrum dev server. These files help VS Code to provide autocompletion and intellisense.

`.editorconfig` configures your editor (e.g. use two spaces for indentation).

`.gitignore` lists files and folders which should not be checked in the repository.

`README.md` is a quick getting started guide to run and build the project.

`babel.config.js` configures babel to transpile the porject to a version of JavaScript supported by the target browser.

`public/` contains static files like `index.html` and `favicon.ico` etc.

`src/` contains the source of the application.


The `src/` directory has following files:

```
- components
- router
  - pages
- store
  - containers
  - middlewares
  - reducers
```

#### Routing

Spectrum application support directory based routing e.g. `src/router/pages/index.jsx` is registered to route `/`.

Examples:

- `/home` - `src/router/pages/home.jsx`
- `/products` - `src/router/products.jsx`
- `/products/` - `src/router/products/index.jsx`
- `/products/:id` - `src/router/products/_id.jsx`

> Spectrum application scaffolds in project docs. Read all the `README.md` files.
