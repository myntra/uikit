# Spectrum CLI

A webpack based development environment with zero-config build system heavily inspired from [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/). It uses plugins to enhance build-time and runtime experience.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --global @myntra/spectrum-cli@alpha
```

You might need to setup Myntra private npm registry. Skip this if above command finished without any error.

```bash
npm config --global set @myntra:registry http://registry.myntra.com:8000/

```bash
spectrum --version

# Output
# 2.0.0-alpha.62
