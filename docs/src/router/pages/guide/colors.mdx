# Colors

The SCM color palette is designed and implemented in a themeable manner.

- The colours are equal in status. They always appear in full tone and may not be darkened, lightened or displayed transparently.
- The color variables are determined by common roles and usage; it is not based singularly on a color value (i.e. unique hex code).
- The same color value may be assigned to multiple variables in a theme's palette when the values have distinctly different roles.

## Primary Color

<ColorPreview name="Primary" {...tokens.colors.primary} />

## Gray - Neutral Color

<ColorPreview name="Gray" {...tokens.colors.gray} />

## Green - Success Color

<ColorPreview name="Green" {...tokens.colors.green} />

## Red - Error Color

<ColorPreview name="Red" {...tokens.colors.red} />

## Yellow - Warning Color

<ColorPreview name="Yellow" {...tokens.colors.yellow} />
