# Typography

Typography is used to create clear hierarchies. The headline, sub-headline and body copy take effect at different levels, as we know. The typography can do a wonderful job in supporting this. The font styles of Nuclei Type create a flexible system which is understood intuitively.

## Type Scale (Title & Headings)

<Typography
  headers={['title', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4']}
  tokens={tokens.textStyles} />

## Type Scale (Body and Other)

Other than headers, all other text styles should follow these guidelines. Caption should only be used for supporting text and all important copy should use body copy styles due to contrast.

<Typography
  headers={['body', 'paragraph', 'caption', 'button', 'textLink']}
  tokens={tokens.textStyles} />
